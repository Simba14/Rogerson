    __html: `Ben Rogerson is a writer based between <span class='HighlightFirst'>Amsterdam and Berlin</span>. He mainly avoids writing by attending the cinema by day, and music by night. When able to overcome his attention deficit, his texts are mainly concerned with <span class='Underline'>experimental music</span>, <span class='HighlightSecond'>the dance music community</span>, independent cinema and sports. Recent pieces have appeared on Schmutz, Truants Blog and the Amsterdam based cultural institutions Trouw and De School.`,
