      content: `Kate Miller will continue to pour curated naughtiness over summer dance-floors at De School this Friday. The far-reaching radio and club selector has been described as a ‘musical chameleon’; bringing her sets to life with colours more vibrant than Ari Aster’s Midsommar. How can we best capture and communicate musical experience? And what drives her to continue uncovering music after all these years? She opened up and leant us her thoughts in advance of her upcoming set this evening.


Q: I read a lot of interviews trying to put words to your sets and style. For me words often don’t do justice or get close to how the music truly feels, and at times can even inhibit one’s perception of it. Particular for artists like yourself who are willing to play different kinds of music along many avenues. How do you feel by people trying to put your music into words?

A: Of course people always try to describe music with words, myself included when I’m writing promotional texts for the Oscillate parties I organise, but in the end you just have to hear the music if you want to understand it. Words can never encapsulate the breadth and depth and energy of the music. It’s also so subjective. One person may hear one thing, or focus on one aspect of the music, and write about that part, while another person hears something completely different! It’s necessary for journalism and promotion but almost useless in trying to gain a true understanding of the music one plays or creates.

Q: With dance music writing, I also sometimes long for information about the spaces in which the music was played. Where the feedback between space, crowd and DJ is so important to the overall experience. How important is the space you’re playing in as to how you communicate through your music?

A: Yes, I find these aspects much more interesting to read about in music journalism. These are the things that can transport the reader to the party and the space and provide the context in which the music was heard and enjoyed. As a DJ the space, context, crowd, time of day, all of these things, have a huge impact on the way the music is received as well as which tracks are chosen. For example, I rarely enjoy “cheesy” music on the dance floor. Of course I love to listen to 80s disco in my kitchen but on the dance floor I prefer rough electro and deep dubstep (there I go trying to describe music with words), but last weekend I was at Nachtdigital, the last Nachtdigital after 22 years, and hearing Nelly Furtado - All Good Things Come To an End nearly brought me to tears. It was the context, the setting, the shared experience. Standing on the beach looking over the lake with my closest friends, tired from the weekend and feeling so grateful for the wonderful experience we’d just enjoyed but also sad that it would be the last time. This song was perfect for the moment. But of course I won’t play that song tonight at De School. It wouldn’t fit at all. The thing I love most about De School is the darkness. Nobody can see anything so they have nothing to focus on except for the music. This means I get to play subtle, rich textures. They have the room they need to be fully appreciated in that space.

Q: I feel like you capture this somewhat through the photos of your Instagram. There was a photo of blue sky peaking through the green trees in the garden at About blank, and in true British style, a grey clouded sky above Latitude festival. It takes you back to the event without having to use words to do so. Do you feel like visuals (photos, videos etc.) can do a better job of capturing the mood of your music, or the events you play, than words can?

A: I think you can explain a lot with words that you can’t with pictures like the reason why people are throwing a party; are there political aspects? Is it the last edition of the festival? Where and why did the music they are playing develop? But the picture of the venue can take you right there to the feeling of the space. The openness of the festival forest, the brilliant stage design and lighting or the intimacy of the rave dungeon.

Q: I like the titles of some of your mixes, because rather than offering a description of the music, it instead describes a place or journey in which the music could be placed. Such as ‘music for subaquatic travel’. Do you often envision a certain context to place your music? Particularly when you’re not out there DJing, making podcasts or radio shows?

A: Yes, I like to come up with a narrative for each mix. It helps me paint a common thread throughout the mix and also keep each mix different from the last. I don’t want to make another version of the same thing every time so it helps to give me a direction. The mix you mentioned was inspired by Organik Festival in Taiwan. Although I’ve never been there, friends always rave to me about it and I’m inspired by the artists who play there. People like Valentino Mora, Dorisburg and Martinou. I’ve seen photos of the stunning location, forested mountains leading down to the beach drenched in rain, and listened countless times to recordings from the festival. It seems like a magical place and a particular sound seems to suit it best. I like so many different styles of music so having a theme helps me to focus on one thing, at least for an hour anyway. Although that doesn’t always work out, so many of my other mixes are pretty frenzied and erratic, which I also like.

Q: You’ve been co-curating and playing at the Oscillate parties at about:blank, your music feels right at home in the garden there. Is there something about this space in particular that feels special to you, that keeps calling you back to host your events and play there?

A: Oh yes, about:blank is our home. Especially the garden, it’s so beautiful. Out there on a Sunday in the summertime it feels like a small festival. I love that the dance floor is round with the speakers going all the way around, it creates a kind of bubble feeling on the dance floor. The garden expands out into a little jungle behind the dance floor and inside on the lobby floor is probably where I’ve played the most of anywhere in the world. I know that room so well now and feel so comfortable to explore anything and everything. I’m really grateful to have a residency in Berlin. It’s quite rare these days.

Q: You built your DJ form up in Melbourne, and now based in Berlin, you play often across Europe and the world. After this jump and playing in a wider variety of places, do you feel that there are certain places in the music scene where you feel you belong more than others? Does this sense of belonging play a role in how much joy you take from being a DJ?

A: I do feel a sense of belonging at my own parties and that does create a very special sense of joy and satisfaction, but playing on unfamiliar territory is also very exciting to me and sometimes more satisfying because you really never know which way it’s going to go. I love to see how far I can push my style with new crowds and to connect with people from places I’ve never been before.

Q: Is there a particular spot which feels most like home to you?

A: Playing in Melbourne feels very special. I left Melbourne 8 years ago to move to Berlin and I honestly miss it every day. So being able to go back and rejoin that community and connect with my home is very special. That being said when I think of my “DJ home” I also think of Stattbad, which is where I had my first residency in Berlin. It sadly shut down a few years ago but the bookers there gave me my first opportunities to play in a big nightclub alongside some idols of mine. The abandoned pool complex had so much character and they did such a great job with the lighting and sound. My parents even came to visit and heard me play there. I was there for 3 or 4 years and if I imagine being able to go back inside those walls with that crew, that would definitely feel like home.

Q: If you could place your music somewhere totally new, where would you want it to be?

A: Anywhere and everywhere. I want to spread it like wildfire! Playing in Georgia was a wonderful experience, getting to see that beautiful country and eating their incredible food wasn’t bad either, hehe. I also loved playing at PLX Festival in Sweden last year. It’s just 800 people on a tiny island only reachable by boat. I guess I’m living the fantasy. I also can’t wait to play at De School tonight. It’s one of my favourite clubs. Ever since the last time I played there I always ask the lighting technicians at other clubs to turn the lights down. I love playing in the dark. No one is thinking about how they’re dancing or looking at anyone else. There’s no judgement or thinking, just listening and dancing. That sense of anonymity is great. I’ve heard rumours that it’s closing soon too so that adds a bittersweet touch. Maybe I will play Nelly Furtado after all, haha! I’m just so grateful for all of these opportunities and experiences that I wouldn’t want to ask for more.


Q: You’ve been playing now for many years. You continue to find new gems and nurture your own style. What exactly is driving you to continue searching for new music? Or is there simply a natural spark which never seems to die out?

I’ve been playing for 10 years, but yes quite a while now! Honestly, sometimes the hunt for new music can feel routine and tedious! Some days I ask myself what the point of traveling around playing “doof doof” to people is. It feels like such a silly job! But then I have an experience on the dance floor and I remember. It’s life-affirming stuff. Music is a pure celebration of life. It’s connection. What more could anybody ever dream of achieving with their work? For me, music is the most direct way to connect with others. No words, just pure energy. When the sound comes out of the speaker, it goes right into your chest. You can’t avoid it. Everybody takes what they need from the dance floor. Whether it’s just a few hours away from work to release the tension and brush off responsibilities till the next day, or if it’s to challenge yourself musically. It could be going out despite your government telling you not to. Dancing in the face of adversity. Dancing to express your sexuality. Dancing to show the world you’re not afraid. Or just for the fun of it. It could be for any reason, but whatever it is, it’s beautiful, and beauty is the most important thing in life. Without it, it’s not worth living.

      title: "Angel Olsen: All Mirrors",
      slug: "angel-olsen-all-mirrors",

        "https://www.schmutzberlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/angelolsen_allmirrors.jpg",
      content: `Angel Olsen is a dreamer. A few years ago, when she uncovered a dream-house in Asheville, it became her obsession. Unable to afford the house at the time, she couldn’t make it her reality, but a few years later she bought a house opposite in the same street. Dream or reality, the image across the road still plays an important symbolic role for her. She brought this story to light in an interview with The FADER this year. “Now, every day when I leave my house, I look at my dream house,” she says. “And that’s all I needed. I needed it to be something that existed in my mind as a dream house, and it’s so symbolic for me. As you get older, you romanticize narratives about the people in your mind, about the people you love, why you’re close to certain people, like, It’s so sweet we both loved poetry.”

Olsen’s All Mirrors is an exploration of the dreams and illusions of her own mind, and the strain and joy these place on her sense of self. In the aftermath of a break-up, she faces up to her own visions of romantic love and forever-love; whilst also bringing to light the illusion of the artist, of language, of her hopes and dreams. Far from the stripped-back, smokey, singer-songwriter folk of her early albums, her use of a 12-piece string-section fills the album with a new voice, allowing her distinctive vocal tones at times to take a back-seat. Though a continuation of the lonely heartache of her former albums remains, her self-awareness brings with it a lightness and optimism that allows us to be optimistic even in her most painful moments.

While Olsen’s dream-house encourages her to fantasize about the future, many tracks of All Mirrors find her nostalgically looking backwards at former romances. She captures these distant realities through a variety of illusory images. As love in a movie in “Chance”: “I’m walking through the scenes / I’m saying all the lines”. Or with a vision of heaven in “Spring”: “Give me a heaven / just for a while / make me eternal / there in your smile”. She both indulges in and satirises the other-wordly narratives she finds herself continually falling into. Olsen is aware of her own susceptibility to fall into these traps, but they nonetheless expand the worlds within which she can bring her memories and music to life.

But her tendency to construct and buy into these illusions is not without complication. She recognises her own vulnerability in buying into these fantasies, and how she can lose part of herself in the process. Title track “All mirrors” captures the essence of this. Confronting her reflection in the mirror, she reminisces of a youthful beauty which has faded. “Standing, facin’, all mirrors are erasin’ / Losin’ beauty, at least at times it knew me”. As she compared this to her idyllic relationships which once were, she struggles to confront her new reality. The elision on the shortened words: facin’; erasin’; losin’ –  further reinforce this. Even her words and language are degraded – something lost, or missing, that once was.

This sense of erosion is reinforced in Spring, where the duality of the artist is brought into question. “How time has revealed how little we know us / I’ve been too busy, I should’ve noticed”. It’s unclear if the ‘we’ she refers to here is her and a former partner; or simply the two co-existing versions of herself: Olsen as artist, Olsen as individual. Has Olsen committed so strongly into her life and narrative as an artist that she has left her former self behind? While the album is inherently inward-focused, Olsen prevents the album from slipping into indulgence. Her awareness allows her to bring light-hearted moments of self-mockery: “maybe you just want / Just to feel something again / You just wanted to forget / That your heart was full of shit”.

With a voice as distinct and powerful as her own, Olsen tactfully avoids becoming over-reliant on it; which brings with it a certain humility. Instead she makes use of thick periods of instrumentation, like the meandering guitar solo on “Spring”, or the various climaxes of the 12-piece string orchestra, such as those on “Lark” and “Tonight”.

Her structural skill enables her to keep the album dynamic whilst empowering some of her key themes. The way in which her voice is slowly overpowered by the string orchestra on “Lark” is an excellent example of her own humility; her voice becomes secondary to the powerful strings which build slowly and eventually envelope her – muting her cries in the process. A couple of tactful tempo changes, those in “Too easy” and “Summer” allow her to sweep us away from feelings of darkness towards moments of optimism – breaking through periods of turmoil to provide us with respite. “And then one moment I was blown away / And there was nothing left that I could say.“

It is a testament to Olsen’s composition that she can make use of the strings in such a variety of ways. From the epic climaxes of “Lark” and “Summer” to the mellow romantic strings of “Endgame”, evoking tones of 60s love-songs. Synths and kicks in “Too Easy” bring a cinematic, dream-like conception of former romance to life in a sound calling back to the synthy-pop of My Woman. Her commitment to variety within the confines of her tonal-range push her away from center stage, allowing her to drift in and out of focus – much like the evasive self she finds so difficult to grasp.

Olsen poignantly captures the extent to which romantic journeys are so often a journey of the self. Constructed within illusory frameworks that even awareness cannot help us from falling into. Within these frameworks we find our reflections. Each mirror a phantom of a certain reality that brings our own vulnerability into question. Olsen extends the range of her compositional capacity here, incorporating new instruments to expand her sound and strengthen her message. All mirrors is a confident depiction of the troubled understanding of our self in the midst of heartache: if it’s all mirrors, where does the illusion end and truth begin? `,

      content: `Q: I kind of just want to do that thing that films do, you know where the scene begins mid conversation and you’re right into the action?

      A: Yeah I know what you mean – Like 'Coffee And Cigarettes'.

      Q: But where are you right now? Rotterdam right?

      A: Yeah I’m in Rotterdam, I live close to the water here.

      Q: Still working at Clone?

      A: Nah not anymore. I enjoyed it but I’m looking for something a little more intellectually stimulating to do alongside my music stuff. Something to do with my study. Although, I still go there almost every week of course.

      Q: What was it you studied again?

      A: I studied urban sociology, like city planning, improving neighbourhoods etc. Especially the interplay between the physical structure of cities and the social element, like the way people interact. That’s something I am interested in.

      Q: Ah that’s really interesting, I sometimes think about how that affects Amsterdam, I don’t feel like it’s designed in a way where people in the outer areas can integrate much with the people of the centre. It also doesn’t seem able to handle the demands of globalisation too – it can get so hectic.

      A: Yeah I totally agree. That’s one of the reasons why I moved to Rotterdam. I felt kind of suppressed in Amsterdam, in those busy central streets. It’s not really geared to accommodate a lot of people.

      The entire centre can be seen as one big 16th century monument, and that creates a challenge structurally. If you compare it to a city like Berlin, there’s way more space there – it’s a little more logically structured, and suited for modern living.

      Q: Is that similar in Rotterdam too?

      A: Yeah Rotterdam is spacious too, it has large streets, many empty buildings. I’m also really into architecture. One of those empty buildings is just around the corner from my house. It’s called the HAKA-Gebouw. It’s the abandoned building of the fruit-trading corporation, they imported and distributed fruit from all over the world. I like the shape of it – it’s pretty beautiful to me.

      Q: Are there also other buildings you like?

      A: Most people know this one – it’s called the Van Nelle-fabriek. It’s one of the first and most famous modernist buildings in The Netherlands. They produced coffee and tobacco here, it’s from the 1920s/30s. I actually once played at someone’s graduation party there, in an upper floor room with a beautiful view. It was definitely the worst echoey sound, but the best view I ever played with.

      Q: I’m enjoying the way this is heading as a digital tour, what’s coming next?

      A: This building will be part of the Boijmans van Beuningen Museum, a modern art museum with classical pieces too. They change their selection in the museum often, but here you can see the entire collection on display.

      They once had a cool exhibition with two pieces in a large room. One side there was a video of two hooligan crews fighting, viewed from above on a high building. On the other side there was a renaissance painting of purgatory. You could sit there in the room without pressure, enjoy and think about them both.

      I just sent you another picture of a building I like, an old squat from the late 1800s, Sil from Clone used to throw his Midlight parties there a few years ago, it’s just south of the Maas.

      The tour continues…

      I have one more, this one is really cool. It’s the Henry Moore sculpture. If you scroll down to the second picture you can see more clearly. On the bottom right there is a brick wall. They actually transported the wall from another building and fit it directly into this new one. I really like this, it’s completely out of place – odd and dissonant..

      Q: When it comes to urban sociology where are you getting your ideas from, are you reading much?

      A: Yeah I like to read books. A good one is ‘Happy City’ – it’s a study on how structural elements of a city can directly affect happiness. Like something as simple as making a staircase more accessible instead of an elevator, you get more human interaction.  This is the kind of stuff I’m interested in, ways to develop more inviting public spaces.

      Q: You seem to have some knowledge stored up on this, I’m surprised you didn’t find a role yet.

      A: I need to give it a little more effort, but maybe we can turn this interview into an open application for city planning positions?

      Q: Haha - great idea man! My only concern though, is if we find you a job does this mean there’s a threat to your music career?

      A: Absolutely not, I just want something on the side to keep myself intellectually stimulated. I still really enjoy DJing, and I’m working on a new more experimental project alongside that which is keeping me engaged. The opportunity to play live was first given to me by Shane Burmania, one of the programmers at Muziekgebouw aan ‘t IJ, he invited me to play live for the first time at the World Minimal Music Festival. He’s a guy with great ideas who doesn’t get enough credit for the work he does.

      For the concert on Saturday evening I’ll be building on the piece from World Minimal Music Festival. It’s going to be quite special in the middle of the audience under the Warping Halos artwork from Chrildren of the Light. But I am much more nervous for the Monday morning closing Het Muzieklokaal. I already get butterflies in my stomach when I think of tracks I want to play. I’ll be playing both live and DJ next week during ADE at De School.


      Oceanic's live performance will be in De Aula on Saturday night, along with Iona Fortune and JD Twitch. His closing set will be in Het Muzieklokaal, Sunday night from 05:00 until close.`,

      content: `Liminal phenomena and liminoid states are transitional phases in which a familiar order sees its values and symbols destabilised; norms are suspended or turned on their heads. They thrust us into the grey zone between the two sides of a supposedly clear demarcation. We find ourselves in ambiguous spaces, somewhere between a past that is no longer valid and an ever-becoming future. (CTM Festival, 2020).

Next January, CTM’s 2020 edition will explore Liminality, the phase between the old and the new; the space between boundaries: opening up an exploration of what lies between the supposedly clear definitions that separate and segment our present context. A transitional period takes place when norms are uplifted, and in that transition between what was, and what will become, we are opened up to new possibilities. With this newfound movement and freedom, conventions and norms become challenged in new ways.

In many ways, the current nature of Berlin’s night-life could be said to fit into this notion of liminality. While, for decades, a narrow sound and aesthetic has been both reinforced and perpetuated by club line-ups often lacking diversity in both the types of sound and the artists showcased, there has been a reinvention of electronic music events across the city. Organisers like Creamcake, 3HD, Atonal, Janus, Yegorka and the club space of CTM’s Pre-party series Trauma Bar are fearlessly pushing forward parties with a focus on diversity in artist and experience. The aging Berlin hegemony was growing tired, and seemingly certain audiences along with it too. The reality is that in Berlin now, on a Thursday night you can consistently attend a night with challenging, expansive, cross-genre experimental artists; and see a crowd full of curious people eager to accept that challenge. We are in a time now where the regimental norms of the scene are being upended: it is unarguably within a liminal phase.

The second of CTM’s pre-party series ‘Sub Liminal #2: A CTM 2020 Future Prequel’ offered an early peek into the festival to come, and an exemplary case of this alternative form of party: selecting a line-up of performers that defy definition, flicking and blurring between genres with grace. The night took place at the effervescent Trauma Bar und Kino, which has become a pioneer for nights such as these. Two live-acts laid down their work: Kablam and South African Duo Faka. Self-described by CTM as an artist who “skillfully weaves new narratives out of the sounds of yesterday, today, and tomorrow”; Kablam is a poignant example of liminality. An artist who both draws on, and pushes forward, the sounds of the past to propel the dance experience forward. Her sets routinely call back to 90s and 00s classics whilst entertaining the forward-thinking, polished sounds of today. Faka remained the party’s highlight; in a rhythmic and unavoidably danceable concoction of singing and poetry. The live acts fell amongst two emphatic DJ sets from DJ Haram and Pininga: the former melding Middle Eastern music with bold percussion, and the latter drawing on their Brazilian background amongst a backdrop of bass-heavy, far-reaching styles. Each artist represented the move away from tight-knit definitions, unafraid of provocative explorations of different genres and styles. As a consequence the event felt both fluid and unpredictable, bringing a sharpness and new direction to each performer as they took the stage.

If the thought of a set moving beyond the safe confines of 120 BPM, 4-4 beats for hours on end makes you sigh, perhaps it isn’t for you. But for those growing a little jaded with the reproduction and reinforcement of certain names and styles and sounds on line-ups on the big stages in Berlin, showing up and supporting an event like these CTM-previews may offer you a fresh experience. In its nature, with its emphasis on diversity and deviation from the norms, chances are that you won’t enjoy everything; perhaps even, find a decent amount of it unenjoyable. Even so, the likelihood is that some music will land hard and there is always something refreshing to be said about a stage full of diverse performers and bodies; in that diversity, a new and curious audience is brought together. For each performer, respect and attention and patience were laid down, and more or less all of the acts brought about a response from the crowd. So when you do have your moment: chances are you won’t be alone in it.

As a poignant example of the phase between the old and the new, the CTM Sub Liminal pre-parties embody the transitory concept of liminality in a variety of ways. It serves as a transition towards the festival itself. A transition towards Berlin’s increasingly diversifying nightlife culture. The curation of the CTM events illuminate these transitions and forcefully bring them into being; the music itself transitioning between ages and genres and sounds. The process of upending norms and recreating our contexts is what the 2020 edition of the festival will explore, here was an early insight into what that might offer. This punchy Thursday-night event was a kindly reminder that a long held-up overhaul of nightlife culture is undoubtedly taking shape.`,
